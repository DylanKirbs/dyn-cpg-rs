# TODO

## Empirical Data
- [x] Tree sitter
- [ ] VLC
- [x] Graphviz
- [x] FFMPEG

## Compare each stage of the pipeline
- [ ] File Changes / Edits
- [ ] Merging dirty ranges
- [ ] AST rehydration
- [ ] CF pass
- [ ] DD pass


## Compare ^ for 
- [ ] Statement level updates
- [ ] Function level updates
- [ ] Full file reparses

## Look into targeted updates for identifiable (structural) changes like identifier name refactors

## Implementation
- [ ] Finish debuging the control flow pass
- [ ] Finish the data flow pass

## Database
- [ ] Integrate with a DBMS
- [ ] Test the performance with DB integration
  - I suspect that this may swing the tides of how the incremental updates perform compared to the full reparses
